<h1>Echoes Through Time<h1>
<p class="subtitle">How Music Has Evolved Across Genres and Decades</p>

<h2>Research Question</h2>
<p>
How has music evolved across different genres and time periods, and what patterns emerge when we examine these changes holistically?
</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
Music is one of humanity's most universal forms of expression, yet it constantly evolving, shifting, merging, and reinventing itself across cultures 
and time periods. Studying this evolution offers insight into the broader cultural, technological, and social changes that shape human experience. 
Our project examines how the music industry has changed over time by using Spotify Track Attributes and Popularity data to compare what made songs 
popular in different eras.
</p>

<p>
This approach is compelling because listeners often don't think about why they like or dislike a song. By analyzing attributes such as tempo, energy, 
danceability, and instrumentation, we can identify what contributes to a song's success. This allows us to model and predict not only what makes 
music popular today, but also what drove popularity in the past.
</p>

<p>
Musical change never happens in isolation. Genres emerge from specific historical moments and respond to new technologies and cultural movements. 
These forces shape the measurable features of popular music, revealing patterns in how styles develop, spread, and transform. Examining these 
patterns holistically helps us understand how music evolves and what distinguishes today's sound from that of previous decades.
</p>

<p>
By blending cultural context with data-driven analysis, we gain a deeper understanding of music's continuous evolution and the factors that shape 
what listeners respond to across time.
</p>

<h2>Introduction to the Dataset</h2>
<p>
Our analysis uses the <strong>Spotify Tracks Attributes and Popularity dataset</strong> from Kaggle, which originates directly from Spotify's 
API. This comprehensive dataset provides a robust foundation for examining music evolution across genres and time periods.
</p>

<p>
  The complete dataset contains approximately 114,000 rows with 20 columns of attributes. For our analysis, we used the <strong>first 15,000 rows</strong> 
  (individual tracks), which provides a substantial and manageable sample size for identifying patterns and trends across different musical eras and genres 
  while maintaining computational efficiency.
</p>

        <h3>Key Attributes</h3>
        
        <p>The dataset includes several categories of attributes that enable multifaceted analysis:</p>

        <h3>Identifying Information:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Track ID</strong> - Unique identifier for each song</li>
            <li><strong>Artists</strong> - Artist or artists who performed the track</li>
            <li><strong>Track name</strong> - Song title for identification</li>
            <li><strong>Album name</strong> - The album containing the track</li>
            <li><strong>Track genre</strong> - Musical genre classification</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Audio Features (Numeric):</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Danceability</strong> - Measures how suitable a track is for dancing (0.0 to 1.0)</li>
            <li><strong>Energy</strong> - Represents intensity and activity level (0.0 to 1.0)</li>
            <li><strong>Acousticness</strong> - Confidence measure of whether the track is acoustic (0.0 to 1.0)</li>
            <li><strong>Valence</strong> - Captures the musical positiveness/mood conveyed by a track (0.0 to 1.0)</li>
            <li><strong>Tempo</strong> - Beats per minute (BPM)</li>
            <li><strong>Loudness</strong> - Overall volume in decibels (dB)</li>
            <li><strong>Speechiness</strong> - Detects presence of spoken words (0.0 to 1.0)</li>
            <li><strong>Instrumentalness</strong> - Predicts whether a track contains vocals (0.0 to 1.0)</li>
            <li><strong>Liveness</strong> - Detects presence of an audience in the recording (0.0 to 1.0)</li>
            <li><strong>Duration_ms</strong> - Track length in milliseconds</li>
            <li><strong>Key</strong> - The key the track is in</li>
            <li><strong>Mode</strong> - Major or minor modality</li>
            <li><strong>Time signature</strong> - Estimated overall time signature</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Popularity Metrics:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Popularity</strong> - Spotify's algorithm-based popularity score (0-100)</li>
        </ul>

        <h4>Temporal Information:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Year/Release date</strong> - When the track was released (pulled from Spotify API as supplementary data)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Data Types and Genre Coverage</h3>
        
        <div class="highlight">
            <p>The dataset contains <strong>16 numeric attributes</strong> and <strong>4 character (categorical) attributes</strong>. Since we're 
              working with the first 15,000 rows rather than the full dataset, our <strong>genre representation is more limited</strong> than what 
              would be available in the complete 114,000-row dataset. This means our analysis focuses on the genres that appear most frequently in 
              this subset. While this narrows our scope, it still allows for meaningful analysis of major genre trends and evolution patterns.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Why This Data Works</h2>
        
        <p>This dataset subset is particularly valuable because it combines objective, algorithmically-measured audio features with metadata that 
          provides cultural context. The audio features allow us to quantify what makes different genres distinct and how they've changed, while the 
          artist, album, genre, and temporal information lets us understand the cultural and historical dimensions of these changes. Even with 15,000 
          tracks, the sample size is sufficient to identify statistically significant patterns within the genres represented, making it suitable for 
          studying music evolution holistically.</p>

<h2>Visualizations</h2>
<div class="transition">
  <p>Now that we understand the data behind our analysis, let's explore what it reveals. Our journey begins with the most striking finding: 
    <strong>how dramatically successful music has transformed over the past four decades.</strong></p>
</div>
  
<h3>Visualization 1: Hit Songs Evolution (1980-2020)</h3>
<div class="viz-container">
  <iframe src="alt_hit_songs_evolution.html" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="takeaway">
  <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
  <p>
  What does success sound like? The answer has changed dramatically. This vizualization reveals how the features of successful music 
  (songs with a 70.0+ popularity score) changed over four decades. The most striking trend is the dramatic decline of valence, dropping 
  from 82% in 1980 to just 51% by 2020, demonstrating music's shift away from happiness, with hit songs becoming noticeably darker. 
  Meanwhile, danceability showed an increase from 45% in 1990 to 69% in 2020, reflecting the growing influence of club culture and electronic 
  dance music. Energy levels remained relatively stable with minor fluctuations, suggesting that intensity has always been a component of 
  successful music regardless of era. These patterns indicate that modern hit songs are characterized by electronic production, darker content, 
  and danceable rhythms, a stark contrast to the high valence hits of the 1980s.
  </p>
</div>

<h3>Visualization 2: Genre Audio Profiles</h3>
<div class="transition">
  <p><strong>The transformation raises a compelling question: Why did successful music change so dramatically?</strong><br><br>
  To understand the answer, we need to meet <strong>the players</strong> in this evolution, which are the genres themselves, each with their own 
  unique sonic DNA...</p>
</div>
<div class="viz-container">
  <iframe src="alt_genre_profiles.html" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

<div class="takeaway">
  <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
  <p>
  This comparative analysis reveals audio characteristics that make each music genre unique, and when we connect these genre 
  profiles to the temporal trends observed in Visualization 1, predictive patterns emerge. Genres heavily dependent on acoustic 
  sound, such as acoustic, bluegrass, and ambient music, face potential challenges in mainstream popularity, as our data shows 
  acoustic characteristics declining by 17% in hit songs from 1985 to 2020. The same goes for songs that rely heavily on a high
  valence like childrens music, might face challenges becoming hit songs. Conversely, genres like chicago-house and club music, 
  which exhibit high danceability and electronic production, align closely with the characteristics that define modern successful music.
  Genre success depends on alignment with evolving listener preferences. Genres with trending characteristics (electronic, danceable) 
  are positioned for broader success, while acoustic-focused genres may face reduced mainstream appeal despite maintaining dedicated audiences.
  </p>
</div>

<div class="transition">
  <p>Understanding the players is crucial, but there's another dimension to this story: <strong>the stakes have changed.</strong><br><br>
  Success in music isn't just different. It's become unpredictable in ways it never was before...</p>
</div>
<h3>Visualization 3: Decade vs Popularity</h3>
<div class="viz-container">
  <iframe src="decade_popularity.html" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

  <div class="takeaway">
  <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
  <p>
 
This analysis reveals the decades the top 30 tracks are from. Most of the songs are from the 2010s to 2020s. The 1950s, 
    1970s, 1980s, and 1990s aren’t even included in this. The 1960s are just scraping by with a single song, and even then, 
    it is on the lower end, with a popularity ranking of 82. This visualization also illustrates how many of the top 30 songs are 
    within each decade when the user clicks on a song. This reveals that the 2020s have many of the top 30 most popular songs. This 
    visualization reveals that songs are more popular in later decades. The most popular song is “Cuff It” by Beyoncé (2022) with a 
    popularity ranking of 92. The increase in popularity in music is likely due to the rise of social media and platforms such as SoundCloud,
    Spotify, and TikTok, which make it easier to put music out there.

  </p>
  </div>
<div class="transition">
  <p>We've seen how success transformed, met the players with their unique identities, and witnessed how the stakes became unpredictable. 
    But there's more to discover: <strong>how has the entire musical ecosystem evolved over time?</strong><br><br>
    Let's explore the broader patterns of change across the decades...</p>
</div>

<h3>Visualization 4: Music Evolution </h3>
<div class="viz-container">
  <iframe src="music_evolution_animated.html" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

   <div class="takeaway">
  <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
  <p>
    Over time, popular music has transformed from a relatively narrow field into a richly diversified landscape spanning nearly every combination of energy 
    and danceability. While the 1960s featured only two genres, acoustic and afrobeats, clustered in mid-range zones, the 2010s to 2020s show dense, wide-ranging 
    distribution as new genres spawned. Energy levels have steadily risen, with club music favoring high-energy sounds, and danceability 
    has similarly migrated upward, influenced by club and afrobeat production. Despite this expansion, core genre identities remain 
    consistent—ambient stays low-energy, afrobeat and club dominate high-energy/high-danceability areas, and acoustic's music holds steady in moderate-energy, 
    high-danceability territory. Popular tracks increasingly cluster in the “sweet spot” of moderately high energy and high danceability, even as niche genres 
    continue to thrive outside mainstream zones. Overall, the musical ecosystem has become far more varied, democratized, and rhythm-driven.
  </p>
  </div>

  <div class="transition">
  <p>As the musical landscape expanded and diversified, another fundamental change was happening beneath the surface: 
    <strong>how long music lasts.</strong><br><br>
    Song duration tells its own story about attention spans, commercial pressures, and changing listening habits...</p>
</div>

<h3>Visualization 5: Song Duration Over the Decades </h3>
<div class="viz-container">
  <iframe src="durationovertimeindex.html" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0"></iframe>
</div>

   <div class="takeaway">
  <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
  <p>  
This visualization is a D3 heatmap that shows the duration of music across different decades. It reveals that from the 1950s through the 1970s,
    most songs were relatively short, generally staying below around 300–400 seconds. There are very few longer tracks during this period. Songs 
    from the 2010s to 2020s show much more variation in duration. While most modern songs still stay under 300 seconds, there are a few noticeable 
    outliers with longer songs.  In the 1950s, the majority of songs were below 200 seconds; however, in the 2020s, the music length is more spread, 
    with most music being between 150 seconds and 300 seconds. Also, over the decades, there is a change in the amount of genres. The 1950s had very 
    little variety in music but as the decades progressed there was a significant change in the amount of genres. This feature also demonstrates how 
    long different genres songs are, children songs are typically shorter, while chicago-house is typically longer. Overall, this suggests that earlier 
    decades tended to have consistently shorter songs, while later decades include a wider mix of both shorter and longer tracks. This also shows an influx 
    in music in the 2000s compared to the mid-1900s. 
  </p>
  </div>


<h2>Conclusion </h2>
<p>
Our visualizations reveal a few things about the data. Visualization 1 shows that while features such as speechiness, energy, and acousticness exhibit 
  less variability, there is a significant downward trend in the feature valence over the years, suggesting that music has become less positive in recent 
  years. In Visualization 2, across the decades from 1950 to the 2020s, ambient music has the highest level of acousticness but also the lowest danceability, 
  energy, and valence. In Visualization 3, songs from the 2010s to 2020s shows greater variability in popularity compared to songs from earlier decades. Songs
  in the 2010s and 2020s are more popular than songs in earlier decades, likely due to the internet and the growth of social media throughout the years.
</p>

<p> 
It is a consistent finding that songs in earlier decades are shorter in length, as shown in Visualization 5. After the 2000s, there is more spread in song length, 
  with a large portion falling between 150 and 300 seconds. This also demonstrates the increase in genres over the years and varying durations. Typically, children's
  music is shorter while Chicago house music is longer in seconds. In Visualization 4, the increase in genres between 1950 and 2020 is shown. This provides a greater
  spread in genres. It illustrates club music having more energy and danceability, while ambient music has less energy and danceability.
</p>
  
<p>
Overall, our data has changed over the decades. This is because of mood, popularity variability, and style. Some features have stayed the same throughout the decades.
  Some future work could include comparing Spotify’s trends to other music platforms like Apple Music or Amazon Music. With this, we would be able to see whether these 
  trends stay consistent across platforms.
