 How has music evolved across different genres and time periods, and what patterns emerge when we examine these changes holistically?
  </h1> 
  <p>
  Our topic examines how the music industry has changed over time. We are using the  Spotify Track Attributes and Popularity data, 
  and with this data, we will compare what made a song popular during each time period. This is interesting because when listening to music, 
  people don’t necessarily think about why they like or dislike a song. This topic enables us to examine specific attributes and understand why a song is
  successful. We will be able to model this and predict not only how a song can become successful in today’s world, but also how songs have succeeded in the past.  
  By examining these patterns holistically, we can better understand how music has evolved and what distinguishes today’s music from that of previous decades.

  We decided to use the Spotify Tracks Attributes and Popularity dataset from Kaggle. 
  This dataset originates from Spotify's APi with 21 columns and over 100 thousand rows. We chose this dataset because 
  not only does it originate directly from Spotify, but it also has columns such as artist name, track name, and album name. 
  With these columns, we can see what albums made an artist popular, and correlate specific popular albums with other attributes,
  such as danceability, duration, and energy. With this data, we can identify patterns across genres, compare how different attributes 
  contribute to popularity, and examine how music has evolved over time.

<h2>Visualizations</h2>
  
<h3>Visualization 1: Hit Songs Evolution (1980-2020)</h3>

  <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
  <p>
  This vizualization reveals how the features of successful music (songs with a 70.0+ popularity score) changed over four decades. 
  The most striking trend is the dramatic decline in acoustic sound, dropping from 82% in 1980 to just 51% by 2020, demonstrating 
  music's fundamental shift from natural instrumentation to electronic production. Happiness and positivity (valence) also declined 
  significantly over this period, with hit songs becoming noticeably darker. Meanwhile, danceability showed a modest increase from 
  63% to 69%, reflecting the growing influence of club culture and electronic dance music. Energy levels remained relatively stable 
  with minor fluctuations, suggesting that intensity has always been a component of successful music regardless of era. These 
  patterns indicate that modern hit songs are characterized by electronic production, introspective emotional content, and danceable 
  rhythms, a stark contrast to the acoustic hits of the 1980s.

<h3>Visualization 2: Genre Audio Profiles</h3>

<div class="takeaway">
  <h3>Key Takeaways:</h3>
  <p>
  This comparative analysis reveals audio characteristics that make each music genre unique, and when we connect these genre 
  profiles to the temporal trends observed in Visualization 1, predictive patterns emerge. Genres heavily dependent on acoustic 
  sound, such as acoustic, bluegrass, and ambient music, face potential challenges in mainstream popularity, as our data shows 
  acoustic characteristics declining by 38% in hit songs from 1980 to 2020. Conversely, genres like chicago-house and club music, 
  which exhibit high danceability and electronic production, align closely with the characteristics that define modern successful music.
  Genre success depends on alignment with evolving listener preferences. Genres with trending characteristics (electronic, danceable) 
  are positioned for broader success, while acoustic-focused genres may face reduced mainstream appeal despite maintaining dedicated audiences.
